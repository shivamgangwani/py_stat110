# py_stat110
This repo contains notes that I made while working through [STAT110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home).  

The idea behind this project is to document my own progress through STAT110. Alongside this, it's good practice for using LaTeX and running
experiment simulations in Python. I generally run simulations for experiments discussed in lectures that don't lend themselves to 
counting intuitively (eg. De Montmort's Matching Problem in chapter 1).
